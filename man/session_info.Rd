session_info(
  pkgs = c("loaded", "attached", "installed")[1],
  include_base = FALSE,
  info = c("auto", "all", "platform", "packages", "python", "external"),
  dependencies = NA,

)

\method{toLatex}{session_info}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{Which packages to show. It may be:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} or \code{"loaded"}: show all loaded packages,
\item \code{"attached"}: show all attached packages,
\item \code{"installed"}: show all installed packages,
\item a character vector of package names. Their (hard) dependencies are
also shown by default, see the \code{dependencies} argument.
}}

\item{include_base}{Include base packages in summary? By default this is
false since base packages should always match the R version.}

\item{info}{What information to show, it can be \code{"auto"} to choose
automatically, \code{"all"} to show everything, or a character vector
with elements from:
\itemize{
\item \code{"platform"}: show platform information via \code{\link[=platform_info]{platform_info()}},
\item \code{"packages"}: show package information via \code{\link[=package_info]{package_info()}},
\item \code{"python"}: show Python configuration via \code{\link[=python_info]{python_info()}},
\item \code{"external"}: show information about external software, via
\code{\link[=external_info]{external_info()}}.
}}

\item{dependencies}{Whether to include the (recursive) dependencies
as well. See the \code{dependencies} argument of \code{\link[utils:install.packages]{utils::install.packages()}}.}

\item{to_file}{Whether to print the session information to a file.
If \code{TRUE} the name of the file will be \code{session-info.txt}, but
\code{to_file} may also be a string to specify the file name.}

\item{object}{A \code{session_info} object created by \code{\link[=session_info]{session_info()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{session_info} object.

If \code{to_file} is not \code{FALSE} then it is
returned invisibly. (To print it to both a file and to the screen,
use \code{(session_info(to_file = TRUE))}.)

\code{toLatex()} creates a character vector of class "Latex" containing
LaTeX markup. To render the output in Quarto or R Markdown, set the chunk
option \code{results} to \code{"asis"}.

\description{
This is \code{\link[utils:sessionInfo]{utils::sessionInfo()}} re-written from scratch to both exclude
data that's rarely useful (e.g., the full collate string or base packages
loaded) and include stuff you'd like to know (e.g., where a package was
installed from).
}
\details{
Columns in the \emph{printed} package list:
\itemize{
\item \code{package}: package name
\item \code{*}: whether the package is attached to the search path
\item \code{version}: package version. If the version is marked with \verb{(!)} that
means that the loaded and the on-disk version of the package are
different.
\item \code{date}: when the package was built, if this information is available.
This is the \code{Date/Publication} or the \code{Built} field from
\code{DESCRIPTION}. (These are usually added automatically by R.)
Sometimes this data is not available, then it is \code{NA}.
\item \code{source}: where the package was built or installed from, if available.
Examples: \verb{CRAN (R 3.3.2)}, \verb{Github (r-lib/pkgbuild@8aab60b)},
\code{Bioconductor}, \code{local}.
}

See \code{\link[=package_info]{package_info()}} for the list of columns in the data frame that
is \emph{returned} (as opposed to \emph{printed}).
